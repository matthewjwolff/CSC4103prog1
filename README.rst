CSC 4103 Project 1
==================

Chosen assignments

1. A script for reviewing notes and codes. (`review.sh1`)
   Note that this implementation does not use the `file` command, 
   as I prefered to use my own solution involving I/O redirection.
2. A script for compiling and running code. (`examine.sh`)
3. A POSIX-compliant file copy. (`copy.c` `Makefile`)
   A Makefile is included for convenient compiling. 
4. A study guide. (`ch1-notes.rst`)
